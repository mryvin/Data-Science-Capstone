    <h1>Airbnb Data Cleaning and Analysis Project</h1>
    <p>This project is a comprehensive analysis of a modified Airbnb dataset. The initial dataset was messy and required extensive cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of prediction models.</p>
    <h2>Files Included in this Repository</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>1 Data Cleaning.py</code> - Python script for cleaning the messy Airbnb dataset.</li>
        <li><code>2 Exploratory Data Analysis.py</code> - Python script for performing EDA on the cleaned data.</li>
        <li><code>2 Exploratory Data Analysis.R</code> - Addendums to the EDA from R.</li>
        <li><code>3 Data Modeling.R</code> - R script for creating a prediction model based on observations from the EDA.</li>
        <li><code>3 Data Modeling.py</code> - Addendums to the data modeling from Python.</li>
        <li><code>4 Machine Learning Model.R</code> - R script for an SVM-based model using different datasets.</li>
        <li><code>4 Machine Learning Model.py</code> - Addendums to the machine learning model from Python.</li>
        <li><code>airbnb_v1.csv</code> - The unclean Airbnb dataset</code>.</li>
        <li><code>playoffs_test.csv</code>, <code>playoffs_train.csv</code> - Training and testing datasets used in SVM-based model.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Project Workflow</h2>
    <h3>1. Data Cleaning</h3>
    <p>The initial dataset was unorganized and messy. It underwent a rigorous cleaning process using Python to ensure quality and usability.</p>
    <h3>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
    <p>Both R and Python were employed to perform an in-depth EDA, uncovering insights, patterns, and trends within the data.</p>
    <h3>3. Data Modeling</h3>
    <p>Observations from EDA were utilized to create a predictive model using both R and Python scripts.</p>
    <h3>4. Machine Learning Model</h3>
    <p>An additional SVM-based model was developed utilizing slightly different training and testing datasets to enhance prediction accuracy.</p>
    <h2>Tools & Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>R</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
        <li>Various data visualization libraries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>Enhancements can be made by incorporating more features into the models or employing different machine learning algorithms to compare performance metrics.</p>
